# 🏄 Harsh Kumbhani

**`Software Developer Student`**

I am currently a student learning software development at 42 Heilbronn coding school. The school is heavily based on peer-to-peer and project-based learning. All coding projects are built from the ground up, planning and designing the solution with code from a provided PDF describing the project requirements. All the projects are shown as repositories on my GitHub.
